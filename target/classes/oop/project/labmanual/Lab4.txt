Question1: Create a class Box that uses a parameterized method to initialize the dimensions of a box. (dimensions are width, height, depth of double type). The class should have a method that can return volume. Obtain an object and print the corresponding volume in main() function.
Hint1: Use a parameterized method to set `width`, `height`, and `depth`, and define a `getVolume()` method that returns width * height * depth.
Question2: Define a class Employee with data members: employee name, city, basic salary, dearness allowance (DA%) and house rent (HRA%). Define getdata(), calculate(), and display() functions. Calculate method should find the total salary and display method should display it. [Total = basic+basic*da/100+basic*hra/100;]
Hint2: Use `getdata()` to input values, `calculate()` to compute the total salary based on the formula, and `display()` to print the employee details and total salary.
Question3: Create a Time class that has separate integer member data for hours, minutes and seconds. One constructor should initialize these data to zero and another should initialize to fixed value. A method should display time in hh:mm:ss format. Finally a method should add 2 objects of time passed as argument.
Hint3: Use constructors to set default or specific values, format output in `hh:mm:ss` in the display method, and add times by summing hours, minutes, and seconds, adjusting for overflow.
